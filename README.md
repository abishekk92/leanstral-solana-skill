# Leanstral Solana Skill

An agent skill for generating formal Lean 4 proofs using Mistral's **Leanstral** model (`labs-leanstral-2603`). This skill enables AI coding agents to formally verify code, prove properties about algorithms and smart contracts, and convert implementations into mathematical specifications.

## What is Leanstral?

Leanstral is a 119B-parameter sparse model (6.5B active) specifically trained for proof engineering in Lean 4. It excels at:

- Generating formal proofs for programs and algorithms
- Defining mathematical structures and properties
- Diagnosing Lean compilation issues
- Reasoning about program correctness and security properties

## Use Cases

- **Formally verify** Solana programs, Rust code, and smart contracts
- **Prove properties** like arithmetic safety, state machine correctness, and invariant preservation
- **Generate Lean 4 code** that models and proves implementation correctness
- **Convert** proof assistant code (Rocq/Coq) to Lean 4
- **Debug** existing Lean 4 proofs or definitions

## Installation

### Using npx skills (recommended)

```bash
npx skills add leanstral-solana-skill
```

### Manual Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Copy `SKILL.md` to your agent's skills directory
3. Install Bun 1.0+ (required for the API script)

## Setup

1. Get a free Mistral API key from [console.mistral.ai](https://console.mistral.ai)
2. Export the API key:
   ```bash
   export MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

That's it! The Leanstral API endpoint is currently free during Mistral's feedback period.

## How It Works

When you ask your AI coding agent to verify code or generate proofs, the skill:

1. **Understands your verification goal** - What property needs to be proven?
2. **Prepares a prompt** - Structures your code and specification for Leanstral
3. **Calls the API** - Uses `scripts/call_leanstral.ts` to generate proofs (pass@4 by default)
4. **Evaluates results** - Presents the best proof with explanations
5. **Iterates if needed** - Fills in `sorry` markers, refines specifications, or adds helper lemmas

## Examples

### Verify a Solana Token Vault

```
Prove that my token vault's withdraw function:
1. Only allows the authority to withdraw
2. Decreases vault balance by the exact withdrawal amount
3. Preserves total token supply across all accounts
```

### Verify Arithmetic Safety

```
Prove that this Rust function cannot overflow for any valid input.
```

### Generate Formal Specifications

```
Convert this Solana program into a Lean 4 model and prove that all state transitions are valid.
```

## Output Structure

The script generates a **complete Lean 4 project** ready for verification:

```
output_dir/
├── Best.lean           # The best proof (fewest sorry markers)
├── lakefile.lean       # Lean build configuration
├── lean-toolchain      # Lean version specifier
├── Main.lean           # Entry point
├── README.md           # Verification instructions
├── .gitignore          # Ignores build artifacts
├── metadata.json       # Timing, token usage, and rankings
├── prompt.txt          # The original verification prompt
└── attempts/           # All completion attempts
    ├── completion_0.lean
    ├── completion_0_raw.txt
    ├── completion_1.lean
    ├── completion_1_raw.txt
    └── ...
```

**To verify the proofs:**
```bash
cd output_dir
lake update  # Download dependencies (Mathlib)
lake build   # Build and verify - if this succeeds, the proof is valid!
```

No `sorry` markers = complete formal verification!
